Takes a list of products from restaurant, provides key details about how much of each product is being bought

Fitness Tracking app:
- Use a relational database (as we are using tables to store information)
- Have an overall table that has each user's id, and password
- Link each row in the overall table to each user's specific table, detailing what food they ate, calories burnt, fitness goals, weight chart, etc.
